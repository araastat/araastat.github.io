  "body": "### Do you have data but don't know where to start?\r\n\r\nWe're living in a seemingly endless data stream today, with everything being tracked and quantified. Maybe you are the one doing the quantifying, or maybe you have some data that you think will be useful to you but don't know how to get started. Data by itself, as you've probably realized, isn't really useful. It just seems a bunch of numbers or words on a spreadsheet or page. \r\n\r\nOnce we align data with some question or some intent to gain understanding, however, data can be immensely powerful! ARAASTAT has worked with many entities from government to academia to private companies to help make data useful. We believe that to utilize the data in hand, it is essential to learn something about your domain to understand your immediate questions, and ensure that the data is aligned with those. We specialize in using modern data engineering, statistical and machine learning tools, and visualizations to help you not only understand what your data says, but reveal its potential through simulation and prediction. This becomes an ongoing process as we work symbiotically with you to delve further into your data to see how it can be leveraged for benefit. \r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with you to unravel the mysteries of your data and set up tools and systems to help you understand, utilize and leverage your data to the fullest\r\n\r\n### Do you not understand a word those data scientists are saying?\r\n\r\nFear not. Yes, data scientists can use a lot of jargon and technical words in their work. We pride ourselves on being able to connect with our clients without resorting to jargon. We believe that if you don't understand what we have done, why we've done it,  or if it doesn't make sense to you, we haven't done our job. We try to make our analytics and visualizations as transparent to you as possible, and help you learn about what we do while working on your projects.\r\n\r\n### Do you want to learn what we do?\r\n\r\nARAASTAT offers training in data wrangling, statistics, machine learning and visualization using the popular R and Python software environments.
